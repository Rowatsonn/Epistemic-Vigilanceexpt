            <p>Player A will answer each question once. After entering their answer, player A will leave advice for player B about what they should answer. Note, player A does not have to be honest about their real answer. 
            </p> 

            <p>Player B will answer each question twice. First, before receiving any information from player A, and then again after receiving information from player A. Sometimes this information will be the advice left by player A (advice), other times it will be accurate information showing player Aâ€™s actual answer (spied information). On some questions player B can choose whether to receive advice or spied information.
            </p>

            <p>After providing your answer(s), you will not be told whether your answer was correct or not.</p>

            <p>At the end of the game, players will earn a bonus. Each time either player answers a question correctly, $0.10 will be added to the bonus fund (totalling $3 if all answers are correct).</p>
